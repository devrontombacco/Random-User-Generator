# Random-User-Generator

## General Info
This little app was a way of testing how to do an api call. Thanks to randomuser.me I was able to bring down some data and generate a person's "profile", as you would in an app with social media component or some service where customers need details about you. 

This app only does GET requests and it only gets data for one 1 person at a time. Future apps will definitely include more substantial requests with much bigger quantities of data. 

### Technologies

  - Coded in Swift4 using Xcode 11
  - Decided to use an MVC style pattern. 
  - I did everything in UIKit using Storyboards.
  - Being focused on api calls there was a need to use DispatchQueue and know when to move a task off the main thread. This was one of the reasons why I decided to try out this type of app, given that async tasks are a core part of iOS development. 
 

### Design 

I came up with the design myself. The three little icons under the user's profile photo would be indicative of extra possible functionality possible, were this a full fledged app. I used AdobeXD for the design.

### Setup
To run this project, just clone it to your desktop and run it in Xcode. Any feedback is welcome!
